This is key for complex projects to be successful, which almost no other company can offer as Omdena can”, says Abhimanyu Bhargava, CEO, Farm-Hand (UK); 2. Vetted: The Top 2% among more than 30.000 applications per year who have worked on similar projects and engagements; 3. Flexibility: You can work with solo engineers or teams of up to five engineers. Up and downscale according to your needs; 4. Hiring: The most important difference is that we want our top talent to be hired and get full-time jobs by other companies.

  utter_top_talent_team_selection_process:
    - text: "Omdena follows a three-step process to select teams of engineers for Top Talent Projects: Agreement: In the first step, Omdena and the client define the project budget, team requirements (such as time zone compatibility, technical expertise, etc.), and the desired team size. Team Selection: After the agreement is signed, Omdena takes on the responsibility of selecting the team of engineers within two weeks. However, before the team selection, there is often a second call between Omdenaâ€™s Head of Projects and the client's CTO to ensure alignment with the specific requirements. Project Kick-off: Once the project team has been confirmed, Omdena organizes a kick-off meeting with the client, and the project begins. While Omdena is experienced in selecting the best teams based on its knowledge of the engineers who have worked with them for months or years, clients do not have the option to select the engineers on their own during the initial team formation process. However, clients are given a 14-day period after the project kick-off to request a full refund if they are not satisfied with the team of engineers that Omdena has selected. This ensures that clients have an opportunity to assess the team's fit for their project and make a decision accordingly."
  utter_top_talent_week_money_back_guarantee:
    - text: "The 2-week money-back guarantee offered by Omdena works as follows:\n\nOnce a Top Talent Project is initiated, the client has a period of 14 days from the kick-off call to evaluate the team of engineers that Omdena has selected for the project. If, within these 14 days, the client is not satisfied with the team's performance or feels that they are not the right fit for the project, they have the option to request a full refund of the amount paid for the project.\n\nOmdena provides this money-back guarantee as a reassurance to clients, allowing them to thoroughly assess the team's capabilities and suitability for their project during the initial stages. If the client decides to discontinue the project within the specified period, Omdena will refund the full amount without asking any questions.\n\nIt's worth noting that, as of the given data, Omdena has successfully run over 80 top talent projects and has not encountered any cases where someone asked for a refund during the 2-week period. This indicates a high level of satisfaction and confidence in the team selection process and the quality of work delivered by Omdena's top talent engineers."

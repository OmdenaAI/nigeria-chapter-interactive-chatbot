# Central Bot Component (Demo)

This library contains a suggestion for a central bot component. This central bot is trained to answer general information about Omdena (based on the "about us" section) and is designed to provide a link whenever the user asks about any one of the other sections of the website (for example: local chapters). 
Once the other bots specialised on the other sections are developed, the files ending with _other will be replaced by dedicated files for each website section.
In addition this bot includes training data on how to handle differen interactions with the user, such as greetings, expression of gratitude, feeling of being misunderstood and out of scope input.

Next Development step:
* Testing the Bot
* handeling complex input that includes multiple intents


Here is an example interaction with the bot:
